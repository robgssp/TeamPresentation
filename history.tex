Goals

\begin{enumerate}
\item It should be suitable for teaching, research, and applications,
  including building large systems.
\item It should be completely described via the publication of a
  formal syntax and semantics.
\item It should be freely available. Anyone should be permitted to
  implement the language and distribute it to whomever they please.
\item It should be usable as a basis for further language research.
\item It should be based on ideas that enjoy a wide consensus.
\item It should reduce unnecessary diversity in functional programming
  languages.
\end{enumerate}
