Goals

1. It should be suitable for teaching, research, and applications,
including building large systems.
2. It should be completely described via the publication of a formal
syntax and semantics.
3. It should be freely available. Anyone should be permitted to
implement the language and distribute it to whomever they
please.
4. It should be usable as a basis for further language research.
5. It should be based on ideas that enjoy a wide consensus.
6. It should reduce unnecessary diversity in functional programming
languages.
